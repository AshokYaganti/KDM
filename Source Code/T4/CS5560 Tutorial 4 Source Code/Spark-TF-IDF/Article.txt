The most important actions that one can perform on a website also tend to be the ones that require one to log in to the website. Banks need to be able to identify a user to know the bank account from which to withdraw. E-commerce sites need a userâ€™s identity so she can be associated with a credit card number, billing address, and shopping cart. Video-sharing sites need to be able to associate unique upvotes with users. Using CSRF, an attacker could force a victim to send the attacker some money, or buy something from them, or upvote their videos.

As an example, my banking website, example.com, does not protect itself against CSRF. You, an unsuspecting example.com user, also happened to be logged in to example.com. Now, malicious user Mallory sends you (and millions of other example.com users, of course) an HTML e-mail including the following tag.
